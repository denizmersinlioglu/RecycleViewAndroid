# Material Design for Android

- It is handy repository for Material design in android studio.

- The project is created based on Raywenderlich.com tutorial : https://www.raywenderlich.com/103367/material-design

- Project contains important implementations of Basic Animations, RecycleView, CardView and Activity Transition with Animations. Also it is a good source for Custom Adapters for RecycleView and CardView. 

- Project uses Androids Palette library for editing images and Picasso for image downloading and caching images. You can find basic implementation of Picasson and Palette, however it would be plaesant meeting for begginers.

- I recommend to start with Starter Project in the tutorial(https://www.raywenderlich.com/103367/material-design) and pace yourself to take every step of tutorial. However it would be practical to copy the code.
